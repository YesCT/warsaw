<!-- proposal
One of the more daunting things we encounter in open source development is
getting enough people to regularly contribute. To be sustainable, we need to
encourage new contributors to participate. To that end, we seek to engage new
contributors and experienced developers alike to participate in mentoring.
Mentoring provides participants with direction and encouragement to help them
find their way. This session is for anyone who would like to learn more about
the Drupal mentoring program, mentoring in open source in general, how to mentor
new contributors, or how to organize their own sprints. We will cover tools
available to mentors, documentation, and practical techniques for mentoring
newcomers. We will include strategies for how to: * Make sure people feel
welcome * Match tasks to participants * Keep people engaged even when they
struggle * Help without being overbearing * Answer questions even if you do
not know the answer * Enable folks to continue afterward on their own.

            <p>I'm Cathy Theys, YesCT in the drupal community and on twitter.
            <p>My job is...
            <br>I've been around Drupal for almost 8 years.
            <br>Initially, I did...
            <br>Drupal has a active mentoring program that started in... 2011 (https://groups.drupal.org/node/164629)
            <br>A mentor is...
            <br>In the past two years I've become a mentor, learning from other
                experienced mentors. I've also organized a bunch of sprints,
                ranging in size from 5 people to 600 people.
                I here at dev days because I enjoy working in person with people
                I normally only work with in the issue queues and irc,
                to meet new people and be moved by their own drupal stories,
                and to learn.
                Talking with people attending the sprints and the session days
                so far, some of you are here to learn about drupal 8,
                some to sprint, some will benefit when they go home with
                skills and knowledge learned here. Some will go home and
                stir up their local communities with meetups, camps and community
                they grow.
                You might go home and implement one small idea,
                and might help your local community grow.

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>How can the community help people become participants?</p>
        <br>every new person is a potential contributor and possible eventual mentor of mentors.
        <p>no assumptions? assume (heh) good intentions?
            <br>redefining contributor, participant, using language that is inclusive,
            watch gender language, skill language, and examples that are held up.
            <br>skill language, not just coding.
            <br>people with usability and accessiblity skills can improve the tools used to contribute,
            <br>issue opening,
            <br>people to triage issues to show they are reproducable, testers,
            documentors, project managers, fundraisers, community event organizers,
            photographers, artists, dev ops, infrastructure, performance or security specialists,
            first time users make great dx testers, people from other projects can provide perspective
            or identify integration issues
            <br>so when we talk about contribution, we can leave the door open for more people
            when we use inclusive language.
            <p>Something else the community can do<br>
            is for active contributors about
            the benefits of sending people to contact mentors and attend mentoring events,
            online or in person.
            <p>changes inside the community can make it more likely new people
            will become participants with a mindset that ever new person
            is a potential contributor,
            <br>using inclusive languages and examples of participation
            <br>having active participants know what to do with new people
            <br>which might be send them to mentors.</p>

            people can overhear interactions between mentors and participants.
            seeing how mentors mentor is like training future mentors,
            <br>anyone who sees how mentors mentor will pick up parts of the mentoring habits.

    <h2>Where do mentors come from?</h2>
    <h3>Engage new contributors and experienced contributors
    <aside class="notes">
        <br>matching tasks, picking simple ones, answering questions we dont know
        and sharing how we find out is how mentors can help bring in people to participate,
        <br>and become repeat participants.
        <br>But where do the mentors come from?
        <br>This is one of the keys to mentoring in public.
        <p>Engage new contributors and experienced contributors
            <br>alike to participate in mentoring</p>
        <br>Experienced contributors will see the mentor interactions
        and reuse those patterns themselves when helping people.
        <br>They can also see what mentors really do, and will see they
        can be a mentor. (Dont have to know answers to all the questions,
        only share how to find answers.)
        <br>Ask in advance for mentors, explain the "qualifications"
        (minimal qualifications and there will be support for mentors).
        Explain the expectations...
        <br>Ask in a pinch. If someone has done a task a few times,
        and a new person wants help doing it, ask that experienced person to help.
        Now they are a mentor.

        <ul>
            <li>document repetitive things mentors explain
            <br>this makes a mentor memory so new mentors know what other mentors have figured out
