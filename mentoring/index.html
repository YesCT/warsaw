    <aside class="notes">

        pre turning them, expose everyone to bits of the mentoring process:
        [can we get a covert image, like undercover, or steth?]
        mentor in public, in a public channel in irc, or in a room where
        people can overhear interactions between mentors and participants.
        seeing how mentors mentor is like training future mentors
        let other people see *how* mentors.

        <p>Let others see how mentors... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure people feel welcome</li>
            <li>Match tasks to participants</li>
            <li>Keep people engaged even when they struggle</li>
            <li>Help without being overbearing</li>
            <li>Enable folks to continue afterward on their own</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>answer questions you don’t know the answer to</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>say I dont know</li>
            <li>lets find out together</li>
            <li>this is how I would find out, start by...</li>
            <li>I would ask …</li>

        They feel like they dont know everything. Let them see people doing
        mentoring who also do not know anything.

    <h2>Habitual Participants<br>to<br>Mentor</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
        now that they are participants, regular participants, and exposed to
        how mentors mentor...
        <ul>
            <li>Ask</li>
            <li>In a pinch, when there is a real need, ask (busy office
                hours, someone could not show up and need a replacement, at
                an in person sprint, ask for volunteers to do a small thing,
                something they would-be-mentor *is* comfortable with.
            </li>
            <li>give would-be mentors a first mentor task they can succeed
                at. For example, if a new participant is having trouble
                setting up webserver in linux, ask a would be mentor that
                you know is comfortable with that. Dont ask a would-be
                mentor to help someone do a Mac set up, if they dont already
                know. Dont ask them to help someone with a call back
                conversion if they have never themselves done one. Save
                asking them to do something they dont know the answer to for
                later.
            </li>
            <li>help without being overbearing, overhear them in their first
                mentoring interactions, stay around the same table, watch
                the conversation in irc.
            </li>
            <li>thank them.</li>
            <li>say one thing they did well. “you were patient when it took
                them 15 minutes to find their php.ini” “your explanation of
                interdiffs really helped that new participant”
            </li>
        </ul>
        Tell stories of us being turned into mentors.
        Cathy: denver when did the drush table, and then making a patch live
        to do the change to the drush readme.
